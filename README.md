# Plugin for coq-record-update

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/tchajed/coq-record-update-plugin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/tchajed/coq-record-update-plugin)

[coq-record-update](https://github.com/tchajed/coq-record-update) requires some
boilerplate for each record, to tell the library what the fields of a record
are. This plugin fixes that.

Huge thanks to [Talia Ringer](https://dependenttyp.es/), who told me what arcane
APIs to call while I typed them into an OCaml buffer.
